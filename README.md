# Skill Street Internship program

I have developed a comprehensive notes application as part of an assignment for Skill Street company within a four-day deadline. This application enables users to create notes using Markdown formatting, categorize them through labels, utilize a search feature, and archive notes for efficient organization.

> I put a lot of effort into this project and hope for acknowledgment of my hard work and dedication.
